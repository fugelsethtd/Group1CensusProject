# Group1CensusProject

This repository is for Group 1's project based on the 2019 Businesses census data.
There are two different folders

1. The Python Notebooks folder includes the Jupyter notebooks for each member that will detail the ETL process as well as the visualizations that each member has made.

2. The Project Report folder contains the report detailing the questions each member looked into while exploring the data,
the process of looking through the data, and finally the answers to the questions, accompanied by visualizations to help support the answers to the questions asked.
